# [2021-07-19] Challenge #399 [Easy] Letter value sum

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/20210719_challenge_399_easy_letter_value_sum/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/20210719_challenge_399_easy_letter_value_sum/)

## My initial solution (python)

First working attempt without looking at any other solutions

```python
def lettersum(input_string):
    # determine offset, want 'a' == 1, 'b' == 2, etc 
    offset = ord('a') - 1
    
    sum = 0
    for char in input_string:
        if char == '':
            pass
        
        sum += ord(char) - offset
    
    return sum
```

## Favorite python solution from comments

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/comment/h5t9zs8/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/comment/h5t9zs8/)
```python
lettersum = lambda s: sum([ord(c)-96 for c in s]) 
```

## Reflection

- remember that lambdas are a thing and very useful
- reasonably safe to assume `ord('a') == 97` is always true
- `if char == ''` probably not necessary
